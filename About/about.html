            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this project is to take a sample of records from the
              website www.imslp.org and create a functional and well cataloged
              website. The intent is to create a website that attempts to take
              IMSLP's mission and make it more accessible to general users. The
              intent is to create a website that is more easily browsed and
              searched. It is also important that the records be cataloged
              consistently and clearly.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              The first step was to pick a sample set of records to use. This
              was accomplished by finding ten well known composers and randomly
              selecting to scores for each composer. The next step was to pick
              which elements were essential to the clear and accessible
              cataloging of the scores. These components are listed and
              explained in the core components section. Then, each score was
              cataloging using the core components. The browse and search
              sections were then created. The website for this catalog was
              constructed with a focus on usability and accessibility.

            <h2>Essential Core Components</h2>
            <p>
              The core elements of which users most commonly think are title,
              composer, date, and instrumentation. It is important to include
              not only the title assigned by the composer, but other titles that
              have been associated with the work. This was done as often as
              possible. Another core element is movement titles, which have been
              included. Publisher, type of work, style of work, time period,
              language, and related works were also considered core components.
              These core elements were derived from the cataloging content
              standard RDA with users in mind.

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>
              Catalogs are tricky to construct. This sheds some light as to why
              IMSLP, a fully volunteer operation, has some aspects that are
              difficult to navigate as a user. There were many more features
              which I would like to have added to this catalog, detailed in the
              What's Next? section. It is clear that with all of the effort to
              provide as much information as possible on IMSLP, the user
              experience of the website has fallen short. However, in trying to
              create a better user experience, this project has failed to
              include as much information as IMSLP provides. With time, this
              could be remedied. However, time is a luxury for a non-profit,
              volunteer operation.

            <p>
              -There are many features that could improve this catalog. One
              could be creating an interactive timeline that would facilitate
              browsing by year. Another could be creating an interactive map
              that could facilitate browsing by geographic area. Browsing by
              other core components such as language and instrumentation would
              also greatly increase the value of the browsing feature. The
              search feature should be improved to search by any core component.
              Name authority files could also be created. One more aspect that
              could increase the value of this site as a resource would be to
              increase the linking to other resources. Authority files could
              link to LC and VIAF name authority files, dates in each record
              could link to the browse by date page, and many more opportunities
              for linked data.
