            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this project is to take a sample of records from the
              website www.imslp.org and create a functional and well cataloged
              website. The intent is to create a website that attempts to take
              IMSLP's mission and make it more accessible to general users. The
              intent is to create a website that is more easily browsed and
              searched. It is also important that the records be cataloged
              consistently and clearly.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              The first step was to pick a sample set of records to use. This
              was accomplished by finding ten well known composers and randomly
              selecting to scores for each composer. The next step was to pick
              which elements were essential to the clear and accessible
              cataloging of the scores. These components are listed and
              explained in the core components section. Then, each score was
              cataloging using the core components. An emphasis was placed on
              including linked data in the records as often as possible. An
              authority record was also created for each composer. The website
              for this catalog was then constructed, with a focus on usability
              and accessibility.

            <h2>Essential Core Components</h2>
            <p>
              The core elements of which users most commonly think are title,
              composer, date, and instrumentation. It is important to include
              not only the title assigned by the composer, but other titles that
              have been associated with the work. This was done as often as
              possible. Another core element is movement titles, which have been
              included. Publisher, type of work, style of work, time period,
              language, and related works were also considered core components.

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>
              Catalogs are tricky to construct. This sheds some light as to why
              IMSLP, a fully volunteer operation, has some aspects that are
              difficult to navigate as a user.
